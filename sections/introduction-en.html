<h2 id="intro" class="list">SCOPE OF THIS GUIDE <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

   <h3>1.1 Scope </h3>
<span class="markdown"> This document provides information on the application of the common specifications for the register of
railway infrastructure as referred to in Article 49 of Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the Parliament and of the
Council on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (RINF) therefore referred to as the Interoperability Directive.
This document does not introduce any new legally binding advice. It serves as a clarification tool for legal
documents issued for RINF without however dictating in any manner compulsory procedures to be followed and without establishing any legally binding practice.
The guide needs to be read and used only in conjunction with the “RINF Regulation” [36] published on 27 May 2019. It is intended to facilitate its application but it does not substitute it. However all information and
advice included in the guide are in line with the intentions of the authors of the system and their understanding of the whole concept.
The guide has been prepared by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) with the support of railway sector organisations and National Safety Authority experts.
The guide is publicly available and it will be regularly updated to reflect progress related to system evolution
and to changes of the TSIs and European standards. The reader should refer to the website of the ERA for information about its latest available edition

 <h3>1.2 Content of the guide </h3>
<span class="markdown">
This Guide is the basic document for all participants of the process of building RINF in European scale: for
National Registration Entities (NREs) to build registers and collect data of their respective member states’
(MS) network. The guide delivers the extended definitions of all the objects and parameters of the RINF. It provides guidance
on the most common situations and solutions advised for modelling the railway network.
Examples and variety of possible solutions should support and unify constructions of registers of different
MS of the EU.
This guide also delivers wide description of parameters, including their format, utility and explanation.
The instructions for use of the RINF via access to RINF application will be published as deliverable of RINF application – they are not included in this guide </span>
